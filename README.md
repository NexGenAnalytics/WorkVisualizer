# Work Visualizer

The WorkVisualizer is an interactive profiler that runs in the browser.

## Contents

Currently, this repository contains the following directories and files:

1. `caliper.config`: The configuration file that will be used to generate the data prior to analysis and visualization. Instructions for use are included below.

2. `app/workvisualizer/`: The core WorkVisualizer web app

3. `scripts/`: Helper scripts for repository management

3. `mockups/`: Sample mock-ups for the end result of the Work Visualizer

4. `data/`: Sample data from running [ExaMiniMD](https://github.com/ECP-copa/ExaMiniMD)

5. `misc/`: Artifacts of development (scripts, plots, and old JSON)

## Generating Data

These instructions explain how to generate a data dump for any given application.

The steps assume that the top-level of the Work Visualizer repository has been exported to `$WORKVIZ_DIR`.

1. Install [Caliper](https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper) with the following configuration (where `${CALIPER_SOURCE_DIR}` and `${CALIPER_INSTALL_DIR}` must be exported beforehand, or filled in manually):
```cmake
cmake -D BUILD_TESTING=Off \
      -D WITH_MPI=On \
      -D WITH_TOOLS=Off \
      -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
      -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="${CALIPER_INSTALL_DIR}"\
      "${CALIPER_SOURCE_DIR}"
```

_Note: At least for the moment, Caliper must be installed in Debug mode._


2. Export the following environment variables:

```sh
export KOKKOS_TOOLS_LIBS=/path/to/libcaliper.so
export CALI_CONFIG_FILE=${WORKVIZ_DIR}/caliper.config
```

3. Run an executable that uses Kokkos
   - This will automatically generate `data-<mpi.rank>.cali` files in the directory where you ran the executable (one file per rank).

## App

These instructions explain how to get the WorkVisualizer web app running locally.

### Set-Up

If it is your first time using the WorkVisualizer, follow these steps to prepare your environment.

1. Install Node.js
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```

2. Install Node Version Manager (`nvm`)
```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
# Close and reopen terminal, or run:
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Install Node.js verison >= 20
```sh
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

4. Install necessary Python packages
```sh
pip install -r ${WORKVIZ_DIR}/app/workvisualizer/requirements.txt
```

5. From the `${WORKVIZ_DIR}/app/workvisualizer` directory, run:
```sh
npm install
```

### Opening the App

Once your environment is prepared, open two terminal instances.

1. In one terminal instance, run
```sh
cd ${WORKVIZ_DIR}/app/workvisualizer/api
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

2. In a separate terminal, run

```sh
cd ${WORKVIZ_DIR}/app/workvisualizer
npm run dev
```

You will see something like:

```
> workvisualizer@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

  ▲ Next.js 14.2.3
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000

 ✓ Starting...
 ✓ Ready in 1983ms
```

The WorkVisualizer is available at the provided local address (in this case, `http://localhost:3000`).

Copy/paste this into your browser to access the app.

### Using the App

1. Click `Upload File(s)` and select any `.cali` files you would like to see analyzed (see Generating Data section above).
    - There are sample `.cali` files in `data/cali` (generated by running ExaMiniMD on 4 ranks for 100 timesteps)

2. Explore the WorkVisualizer, using the `?` buttons for guidance.
